***Game Description***************************** 
This game was inspired by Zombie VS Samurai. There are two portals on both side of the map. Your task is to defend your portal while trying to destroy the enemy's portal
as many times as possible. Once you destroy the enemy portal, it revives, spawns a boss, and increases many enemy stats such as troop level and troop spawn rate. You
get passive income, money for killing enemy troops, and money for destroying enemy portals. Use your money to upgrade troops and spawn troops to defend your portal.
